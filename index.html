    <p class="text-center text-muted">Hi! Before we start talking about my school year in Oakcrest which is 2022 - 2023, I will introduce my self. I am Adwaith Guddeti. I am a 5th grader who loved his 5th grade life. %th Grade showed me what reality even is. Until 4th grade, I thought life was just rainbows and butterflies like I thought nothing could go wrong. In 5th grade, I learned that life has turning points that can be painful. I also learned that public is not always good. 5th grade was so fun, like literally, I joined like 7 competitions in one year. 5th grade was amazing.</p>

  <p>My fourth period in school is AI which for me is GT which is the abbreviation for Gifted & Talented. My GT teacher's name is Mrs. Cates. GT in OIS is very energetic and crazy. We got to make a lot of creative things and almost acted out every small thing. We also had a lot of activities in computers and we were just so loud which made our school day continue very tiring. Also, you guys may be wondering that I skipped 3rd period, but 3rd period will be discussed in a separate section because PE is just so complicated.</p>

  <p>My seventh & eighth periods in school are mathematics. My mathematics teacher's name in Mr. Anderson. Mathematics in OIS is very fun. We got to do a lot a stuff like being the teacher and teaching somebody one of the topics that we learned. One of the exciting things is the Harry Potter competition. All of 5th grade was divided into 4 groups which were Slytherin, Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, & Hufflepuff. I was in team Slytherin. In the whole competition, Slytherin & Gryffindor were in a fierce battle. Fortunately, I caught the golden snitch which gave us a 1000 points and Team Slytherin won. We also stopped Ravenclaw's winning streak of 3 wins in a row. This was at the end of the year in April, 2023 to May, 2023. This was hosted mainly for the STAAR test practice & if you don't know what the STAAR test is, you will know now. The STAAR test is the final test of the year which starts from 3rd grade and goes on until 12th grade. The STAAR test is hosted in Texas, USA.</p>
